# Employee Exit Survey Analysis

**Date:** 21-10-2020

We'll be using the exit surveys from employees of the *Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)* and the *Technical and Further Education (TAFE)* institute in Queensland, Australia to try to answer the following questions:

- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
